# \# vc8-level4

# 

# High-performance code based on VC8 Lattice Cosmology framework

# 

# \## Overview

# 

# This repository contains files related to \*\*VC8 Level 4\*\*, an experimental output from the symmetry-broken E8 lattice model applied to void-informed cosmology. It includes code, metadata, summary descriptions, and performance comparisons.

# 

# \## Files Included

# 

# \- `vc8\_level4\_demo\_code.py`  

# &nbsp; Minimal demo script showing basic usage or invocation of the Level 4 VC8 output.

# 

# \- `vc8\_level4\_metadata.json`  

# &nbsp; Metadata describing how the output was generated, including symmetry-breaking parameters and perturbation matrices.

# 

# \- `vc8\_level4\_performance\_comparison.xlsx`  

# &nbsp; A spreadsheet comparing Level 4 against other VC8 outputs or relevant benchmarks (compression ratio, energy efficiency, etc).

# 

# \- `vc8\_level4\_README.txt`  

# &nbsp; Informal or technical overview (distinct from this main README) focused on research-level context.

# 

# \- `vc8\_level4\_summary.txt`  

# &nbsp; A concise executive summary of key findings or results.

# 

# \## Notes

# 

# This phase of the VC8 research is focused on exploratory validation and comparative benchmarking. Future phases may include:

# 

# \- Structured documentation

# \- Module-based packaging

# \- Integration into simulation pipelines

# \- Peer-reviewed publication prep
